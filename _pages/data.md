## Open Data
The project has a strong focus on releasing open access linguistic resources for the Norwegian language. 
This will be mainly achieved through [the Norwegian Language Bank (Spr√•kbanken)](https://www.nb.no/sprakbanken/en/sprakbanken/). 
In this page we will collect links to the main corpora developed during the project.

* [Zenodo]() (NPSC) consists of 140 hours of audio files and corresponding manual transcriptions of meetings at Stortinget (the Norwegian parliament) from 2017 and 2018. The NPSC is primarily intended as an open-source dataset for ASR development.
